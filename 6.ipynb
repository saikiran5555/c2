    "Yes, hierarchical clustering can be used for both numerical and categorical data. However, the choice of distance metric or dissimilarity measure differs depending on the type of data being clustered.\n",

    "For numerical data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance is commonly used as the distance metric for numerical data in hierarchical clustering. It measures the straight-line distance between two data points in the multidimensional numerical space.\n",
    "Other distance metrics such as Manhattan distance (also known as city block distance or L1 distance) and Mahalanobis distance may also be used, depending on the specific characteristics of the data and the clustering objectives.\n",
    "For categorical data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data requires special consideration because traditional distance metrics like Euclidean distance are not applicable due to the lack of meaningful numerical representation.\n",
    "Instead, dissimilarity measures designed for categorical data are used. One commonly used measure is the Gower distance, which is a generalized distance metric that can handle a mix of numerical and categorical variables. Gower distance calculates the dissimilarity between two observations by considering both the numerical differences (scaled to the range [0,1]) and the presence or absence of matches in categorical variables.\n",
    "Another approach for categorical data is to use a binary distance metric, such as Jaccard distance or Hamming distance, which measure the dissimilarity based on the presence or absence of attributes."
